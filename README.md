# Tele-Virtual Reality: A Study on a Virtual, Socially Distanced TV Experience

## Overview
This repository contains research on leveraging VR technology to enhance the experience of socially distanced television watching. The study explores the feasibility, user preferences, and potential challenges of using VR for long-distance social interactions, with a focus on relationships and shared media consumption.

## Features
- **Virtual TV Watching Experience** – Examining the impact of VR on social viewing experiences.
- **Immersion & Interaction** – Investigating how VR can bridge the gap in long-distance relationships.
- **Customization & Personalization** – Exploring options for avatar representation, environment design, and audio configurations.
- **Usability & Accessibility** – Addressing motion sickness, headset limitations, and interaction challenges.

## Research Focus
This study focuses on defining the ideal virtual TV-watching experience by:
- Conducting **user interviews and focus groups** to gather insights on VR’s impact on relationships.
- Analyzing **existing VR applications** for single and multi-user interactions.
- Identifying **technical challenges and user expectations** for a seamless experience.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Interviews with 20 participants and multiple focus group sessions.
- **Analysis Techniques**: Grounded Theory approach using NVivo for transcription and thematic analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Mind maps, fishbone diagrams, and spectrums of gamified vs. realistic features.

## Key Findings
- Users prefer **realistic representations** over cartoonish avatars in VR.
- Customizable environments enhance engagement and comfort.
- Challenges include **motion sickness, headset weight, and accessibility barriers**.
- Social VR for TV watching is **not yet widely accepted**, but future technology advancements may improve adoption.

## Technologies Explored
- **BigScreen Beta** – A VR cinema application for remote social interactions.
- **Oculus VR** – Examining the limitations and advantages of current VR headsets.
- **Extended Reality (XR)** – Exploring hybrid approaches for balancing real and virtual elements.

## Future Work
- Expanding user studies to include non-technical participants.
- Improving **haptic feedback** and **3D spatial audio** for enhanced presence.
- Investigating **augmented reality (AR) alternatives** to mitigate VR's usability challenges.
- Enhancing **privacy and security** measures for virtual social spaces.
